# 575_Project

This map was created during a group project in my Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization course at UW-Madison. The objective was to create a D3 based map like the Wine Production map, but with multiple menu options for the user to select from. This map allows the user to select from different FEMA declared disaster types and to view their occurrences by state for a selected year.
